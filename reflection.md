- What are your initial impressions of Java? 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Java is much much stricter about variables, a lot of my hurdles were making sure to properly express variable types 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

-Take time to go through the Java syntax dictionary and talk through methods with others. Me and a TA were looking at methods for the random class which led me to find a function perfect for picking a random "canned response". 
    -There are similar dictionaries I cross-referenced which also explained these methods in a more digestible manner, too
    -When you come across an error you can't decode, don't freak out, and look around to see if anyone else had faced a similar issue. Try to think what part of your program may be causing this error, which is usually process of elimination from when you added a feature to the variable type listed in the error. 
-Make sure you know how lists work and make sure you stay within bounds. I had some bounds errors until I realized my random function could be limited to 0-8 to cover all my phrases.
