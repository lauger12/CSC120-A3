- What are your initial impressions of Java? 

I really like Java so far. It's interesting learning the syntax and connecting it to my understanding of objects and methods. It's been a lot of fun figuring out this program, and each problem or bug that popped up seemed to expand my knowledge of how this language works by a lot! The part of Java very strict on variable types has actually been really helpul for tracing any errors, and I've actually liked how debugging in Java works. 

I also noticed that in Java, there are always/usually many ways to solve one problem, which opens many doors for choosing routes best for your program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

Java is much much stricter about variables, so some of my learning moments were making sure to properly express variable types or change between them properly (ex: String[] lists -> strings)

A lot of the structure, or at least for OOP, feels similar to Python in many ways. While the syntax may differ, writing things such as "for" and "if" loops are very akin to how you would in Python. 

It may be that I have a limited knowledge of Python's syntax/classes, but I felt that Java had much of a larger arsenal of Class objects documented online, and with many more functionalities specifically for OOP (since it's an OOP language), which I thought was a cool difference. While Python of course has classes, I felt that the object interactions went so much deeper or more complex in Java, such as the various Classes imported (--random, scanner, and array, to name three, and they all each have their own interactions and methods tied to them). (even features that are specfically defined in Java such as public, private, dynamic, static, etc, while I know you can get similar/equivalencies in python, the fact that you work specifically in these parameters gives the impression that it'll be much more focused and streamlined, especially for larger projects).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Take time to go through the Java syntax dictionary and talk through methods with others. Me and a TA were looking at methods for the random class which led me to find a function perfect for picking a random "canned response". 
    -There are similar dictionaries I cross-referenced which also explained these methods in a more digestible manner, too
    -When you come across an error you can't decode, don't freak out, and look around to see if anyone else had faced a similar issue. Try to think what part of your program may be causing this error, which is usually process of elimination from when you added a feature to the variable type listed in the error. 
-Make sure you know how lists work and make sure you stay within bounds. I had some bounds errors until I realized my random function could be limited to 0-8 to cover all my phrases. 
-Go over the program with other students, even talking through *what* the program should do helps.
+Also trying to use a String[] for my transcript, while with a loop to add the lines to them could've worked, I had decided in the end to use a (String) ArrayList, as it felt more suited for what I had written with splitting and joining strings for inputs.
